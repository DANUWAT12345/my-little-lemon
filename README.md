# React.js Capstone Project - Web App

This is a frontend-focused web application built as my capstone project using **React.js**, **Bootstrap**, and **Formik** for form validation. The project was created as part of the **Facebook React Web Development course** on **Coursera**, serving as a practical recap and demonstration of my web development skills.
